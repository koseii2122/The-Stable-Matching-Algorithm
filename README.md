# Stable-Matching-Algorithm
The Stable Matching or the Stable Marriage algorithm is a mathematical algorithm that finds stable matches between two equally sized sets of elements. 
The algorithm works off two independent preference-frames for each set which allows preference based matching to occur. 
After the initialization a proposal is made by one of the sets and the matching algorithm begins

The solution to the Stable-Matching Problem was first given by David Gale & Lloyd Shapley. The algorithm won Shapley along with Alvin Roth, the 2012 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences
The Gale-Shapley algorithm has a wide variety of uses it is used to pair doctors with hospitals, kidneys with patients, employers with trainees, urban students with magnet schools etc.
